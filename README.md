# 📚 School Ratings Analysis for  A/B Testing  &  🧪 Synthetic Hypothesis Testing in Assesment

Welcome to a hands-on data science project that combines **real-world education data** and **synthetic statistical modeling** to evaluate the performance and impact of school types across the U.S.

This project demonstrates two powerful analytical techniques:
- **A/B Testing** – to compare student-teacher ratios in different school categories
- **Synthetic Hypothesis Testing** – to simulate and measure potential causal effects using synthetic control methods

## 🧠 Project Goals

✅ Explore how student-teacher ratios differ between **Public** and **Magnet** schools  
✅ Understand the **causal impact** of simulated interventions using synthetic control  
✅ Build a replicable and structured analytical workflow in **Jupyter Notebooks**  
✅ Present results with clean **data visualizations** and **statistical rigor**

## 1️⃣ A/B Testing: Public vs. Magnet Schools

📌 **Objective:**  
Determine if **Magnet schools** have a significantly different **student-teacher ratio** compared to **Traditional Public schools**.

📂 **Data Source:**  
`School Ratings.csv`

🔬 **Methods Used:**
- Data cleaning & filtering
- Grouping into Control (Public) and Treatment (Magnet)
- **Two-sample t-test** with visual support

📊 **Outcome:**  
Determines whether observed differences are statistically significant or due to random chance.

---

## 2️⃣ Synthetic Hypothesis Testing: Simulated Policy Analysis

📌 **Objective:**  
Model and analyze the effect of an **intervention or policy change** using a **synthetic control group**.

🧪 **Dataset:**  
**No external dataset used** – all data is **synthetically generated** for precise control and clarity.

🔍 **Methods Used:**
- Create a synthetic control unit (e.g., weighted average of control group)
- Compare real vs. synthetic trends over time
- Evaluate the **treatment effect**

📈 **Outcome:**  
Visualizes what might have happened **without intervention**, helping in **policy impact assessment**.

## 🌟 Why This Project Stands Out

✨ **Dual analytical approach** – Real data + Synthetic data  
📘 **Education domain focus** – Relevant, socially impactful use case  
📊 **Compelling visuals** – Intuitive plots for comparison and insight  
📚 **Academic value** – Demonstrates experimental and quasi-experimental design  
🚀 **Portfolio-ready** – Organized, clean, and well-documented
